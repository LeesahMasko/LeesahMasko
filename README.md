### Hi there 👋 I'm Lisa!


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a website for the non-profit group, Bridges to Prosperity.  They raise funds to build footbridges in rural areas around the globe.  The bridges help adults and children safely get to schools, markets and medical facilities. Making everyday life less precarious. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I possibly can about web-development and computer science.

- 💬 Ask me about which episodes you should skip when watching BattleStar Galactica for the first time.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to skateboard, ride my bike, and bake/eat anything delicious.  I enjoy learning and trying to make everyday life fun!
